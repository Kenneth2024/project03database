      {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "multipleChoice",
        "prompt": "Which choice shows the correct syntax for defining a function named 'value' with paramaters x and y using arrow syntax?",
        "choices": [
          "function value (x,y) => { }",
          "function value = (x,y) => { }",
          "let value = x,y => { }",
          "let value = (x,y) => { }"
        ],
        "correctChoice": 4,
        "explanation": "You must invoke arrow syntax using a variable, so in this case, we declare a variable named 'value' using the 'let' keyword. Also, the parameters x and y must be in parenthases. "

        "id": 2,
        "type": "narrative",
        "prompt": "Which symbols determines if two values are of the same data-type as well as value in Javascript?",
        "correctAnswer": "===",
        "explanation": "Javascript has two different opperators that are able to deetermine whether values are equal. The non-strict equals operator only compares value (regardless of data-type), and is denoted with the symbol '=='. The strict equals operator, on the other hand, which determines if two values are of both the same data-type as well as value is denoted by '==='. "

        "correctChoice": 2,
        "explanation": "In Javascript you can define a variable with both the keywords 'let' and 'var', but 'var' has a lexical scope while 'let' has a block scope."
