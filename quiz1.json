      {
        "id": 1,

        "prompt": "How do you declare an ArrayList of type Integer named 'values?' ",
        "choices": [
          "ArrayList values = new ArrayList<Integer>();",
          "ArrayList values = new ArrayList<int>();",
          "ArrayList values = new ArrayList<Integer>;",
          "ArrayList values = new ArrayList<int>;"
        ],
        "correctChoice": 0,
        "explanation": "ArrayLists cannot be composed of primitive data types, and since int is a primative type, you must use the wrapper class version of int, Integer. Also, ArrayList is a class, which is why is must include parenthases at the end."

        "id": 2,
        "type": "narrative",

          "compare To method",
          "constructor method",
          "equals method",
          "round method"
        ],
        "correctChoice": 1,
        "explanation": "Constructor methods are unique methods that have the same name as the class and no return type. The other methods listed are just built-in java methods."

          "rightAnswerQuiz1.png"
        ],
        "correctChoice": 1,
        "explanation": "The second recursive call does not have a terminal condition, and so it will loop infinitely leading to a StackOverFlowError."
